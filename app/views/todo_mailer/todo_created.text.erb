The following Todo list has been created!

Hi, how are you? Just wanted to let you know that I have created
the following list for your consideration.

 Todo  <%= @todo.subject %>

  <% @todo.todolists.order(:priority).each do |list| %>

        <%=list.task%>     Priority= <%=list.priority %>

  <% end %>

 Todo  END
